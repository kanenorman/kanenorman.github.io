        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to my personal website! My name is Kane and I am currently
          pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at Harvard University.
          Before starting my Master's program, I obtained a Bachelor's degree in
          Mathematics from Southern Methodist University and have worked in both
          the technology and finance industries. In my free time, I enjoy
          staying active, skiing, reading, and watching professional sports. I
          created this website to share my interests in mathematics and computer
          science and hope you find it enjoyable and informative. Feel free to
          browse and do not hesitate to reach out to me with any questions or
          comments.
