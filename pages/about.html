        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to my personal website! My name is Kane and I am currently
          pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at Harvard University.
          Before starting my Master's program, I was a student athlete at
          Southern Methodist University where I graduated with a Bachelor's
          degree in Mathematics. After graduating, I started a professional
          career in tech and finance where I gained valuable practical
          experience. Over the course of my career, I have developed a unique
          and highly specialized skill set with a solid foundation in math,
          computer science, and data manipulation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm passionate about building data intensive applications, using data
          to make informed decisions, and leveraging data, math, and technology
          to transform businesses. In my free time, I enjoy staying active,
          skiing, reading, and watching professional sports.
