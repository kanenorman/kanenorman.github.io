        <h1>About Kane</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to my personal website! My name is Kane and I am currently
          pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at Harvard University.
          Before starting my Master's program, I was a division 1 football
          student-athlete at Southern Methodist University where I graduated
          with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>
          After completing my undergraduate studies, I embarked on a career in
          tech and private equity and quickly garnered recognition for my
          exceptional talent in mathematics, computer science, and data
          manipulation.
        </p>
        <p>
          My expertise lies in helping stakeholders make data-driven
          decisions. I specialize in developing state-of-the-art,
          high-performance applications that handle massive amounts of data. By
          leveraging the power of mathematics and technology, I optimize
          profitability and success for businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my spare time, I enjoy riding Peloton, skiing, reading, and
          watching Formula 1. I created this website to share my interests and
          knowledge in mathematics, machine learning, and computer science. I
          hope you find the content both enjoyable and informative. Please feel
