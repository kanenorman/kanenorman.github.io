        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to my personal website! My name is Kane and I am currently
          pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science at Harvard University.
          Before starting my Master's program, I was a football student-athlete
          at Southern Methodist University where I graduated with a Bachelor's
          degree in Mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>
          After completing my undergraduate studies, I began a career in the
          tech and finance industries, where I gained valuable practical
          experience and developed a specialized skill set in math, computer
          science, and data manipulation. I am passionate about using data to
          make informed decisions, building data-intensive applications, and
          using math and technology to transform businesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my spare time, I enjoy staying active, skiing, reading, and
          watching professional sports. I created this website to share my
          interests and knowledge in mathematics and data science. I hope you
          find the content both enjoyable and informative. Please feel free to
          browse and don't hesitate to reach out to me with any questions or
          comments.
