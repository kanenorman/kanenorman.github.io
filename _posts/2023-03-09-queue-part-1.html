  <h4>Introduction</h4>

  <p>
    Queues are a important data structure used for organizing elements in a
    specific order. In this post, we'll provide an introduction to queues,
    including their strengths, weaknesses, and time complexities for essential
    operations. We'll walkthrough a simple implementation of the data structure
    and explore its performance limitations. We'll then discuss ways to improve
    the performance of the queue and alternative implementations that can
    enhance its capabilities. By the end of this post, you'll have a strong
    understanding of queues, their performance characteristics, and how to
    optimize their design for your specific needs.

  <h4>Queues and FIFO</h4>
  <p>
    Queues are similar to stacks, but unlike stacks, they prioritize oldest
    elements in the structure rather than the newest. This prioritization
    pattern is often referred to as "first in, first out" or
    <span style="color: darkorange; font-weight: bold">FIFO</span>. To provide
    an analogy, think of waiting in line (or "queue" for British readers) to
    enter a coffee shop. The first person to enter the line is the first to be
    served, followed by the second person, and so on. New customers must join
    the rear of the line and wait until the customers in front of them are
    served before it is their turn. In this way, we place a higher priority on
    customers who entered the line first.

  <h4>Queue Operations</h4>
  <p>
    Similar to stacks, queues provide restricted access to their data, allowing
    only the oldest added item to be accessed. This limited access results in
    only three primary operations that can be performed on a queue:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>enqueue:</b> add a new value to the rear of the queue.</li>

    <li>
      <b>dequeue:</b> remove and return the front element (oldest element) of
      the queue.
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>peek:</b> return the front element of the queue, but don't remove it.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <h4>Implementation</h4>
  <p>
    There are multiple ways to implement the queue data structure, each with its
    own advantages and disadvantages. In this series of posts, we will explore
    different implementations of the queue. Our first implementation will be the
    simplest, but it will also have the worst performance. We will use the
    built-in list object as a queue, but it is not optimized for queue
    operations according to
    <a
      href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#using-lists-as-queues"
      >Python's documentation</a
    >.
  </p>

  <p>
    To maintain a consistent interface across our implementations, it is best to
    define an abstract base class that establishes the interface for our various
    implementations. This will ensure some consistency across our
    implementations.
  </p>
  <pre>
{% highlight python %}
from typing import Any
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod


class AbstractQueue(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def enqueue(self, new_item) -> None:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def dequeue(self) -> Any:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def peek(self) -> Any:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def is_empty(self) -> bool:
        pass

{% endhighlight %}
</pre
  >

  <p>
    We will start off by implementing the most basic form of the queue, called a
    simple or linear queue. To get started, we can create a class called
    <code>SimpleQueue</code> that includes one attribute named
    <code>_items</code> used for storing the elements in the queue.
  </p>

  <pre>
{% highlight python %}
class SimpleQueue(AbstractQueue):
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self._items = []
{% endhighlight %}
</pre
  >

  <p>
    Next, we will implement our abstract methods, starting with the
    <code>is_empty</code> method, which simply tells us if the queue contains
    any elements.
  </p>
  <pre>
{% highlight python %}
def is_empty(self) -> bool:
    return len(self._items) == 0
{% endhighlight %}
  </pre>
  <p>
    Next, we can implement the <code>enqueue</code> method, which adds an item
    into the rear of queue. To accomplish this, we can simply append the new
    item to <code>self._items</code>.
  </p>
  <pre>
{% highlight python %}
def enqueue(self, new_item: Any) -> None:
    self._items.append(new_item)
{% endhighlight %}
  </pre>
  <p>
    The implementation of the <code>dequeue</code> method is also
    straightforward. We simply remove the front-most item from the queue, but we
    need to ensure that we don't try to remove elements from an empty queue.
    Therefore, if the queue is empty, we need to raise an exception. Otherwise,
    we can remove and return the oldest element from the front of the queue,
    which is stored at index 0 in <code>self._items</code>.
  </p>
  <pre>
{% highlight python %}
def dequeue(self) -> Any:
    if self.is_empty():
        raise Exception("Can not dequeue empty queue")
    else:
        return self._items.pop(0)
{% endhighlight %}
  </pre>
  <p>
    The final abstract method we need to implement is <code>peek</code>, which
    functions similarly to <code>dequeue</code>. The key difference is that
    <code>peek</code>
    only returns the oldest element in the queue. It does not remove it.
  </p>
  <pre>
{% highlight python %}
def peek(self) -> Any:
    if self.is_empty():
        raise Exception("Can not peek into empty queue")
    else:
        return self._items[0]
{% endhighlight %}
  </pre>

  <p>
    To finish our class, we can implement two dunder methods
    <code>__len__</code> to tell us the number of elements stored in the queue
    and <code>__str__</code> to print a visual representation of the elements.
  </p>
  <pre>
{% highlight python %}
def __len__(self) -> int:
    return len(self._items)

def __str__(self) -> str:
    return ", ".join(self._items)
{% endhighlight %}
  </pre>

  <p>
    This implementation is a straightforward way to create a simple queue using
    Python's built-in list object. However, it's important to note that there
    are better ways to implement a simple queue. Although this particular
    implementation is straightforward, it's worth mentioning that the
    <code>dequeue</code>
    method's efficiency can be significantly improved. We'll dive into the
    details of why in the next section of this post.

        self._items.append(new_item)

    def dequeue(self) -> Any:
        if self.is_empty():
            raise Exception("Can not dequeue empty queue")
        else:
            return self._items.pop(0)

    def peek(self) -> Any:
        if self.is_empty():
            raise Exception("Can not peek into empty queue")
        else:
            return self._items[0]

    def is_empty(self) -> bool:
        return len(self._items) == 0

    def __len__(self) -> int:
        return len(self._items)

    def __str__(self) -> str:

    <h4>Big-O Analysis</h4>
    <p>
      Below are the time-complexities of our current implementation. Access and
      insertion are extremely efficient, but search and deletion have poor and
      average time complexities, respectively.
    </p>
    <div class="table-wrapper">
      <table class="alt">

          <tr>
            <th>Operation</th>
            <th>Time Complexity</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>Access</td>
            <td>O(1)</td>

          <tr>
            <td>Insert</td>
            <td>O(1)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Search</td>
            <td>O(n<sup>2</sup>)</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Delete</td>
            <td>O(n)</td>
          </tr>

      </table>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Accessing elements in a queue is possible in constant time, regardless of
    its size. This is because the <code>peek</code> method controls access and
    simply returns the item stored at index 0 of the Python list
    <code>self._items</code>. To understand why this operation takes O(1) time,
    we can take a look at how Python's built-in list object is implemented.
    Python is implemented using the C programming language, and the List object
    is implemented using C's contiguous array, as explained in the
    <a
      href="https://docs.python.org/3/faq/design.html#how-are-lists-implemented-in-cpython"
      >Python documentation</a
    >. As we learned from our post on
    <a href="{{'/programming/arrays' | relative_url}}">arrays</a>, this
    contiguous memory storage allows for O(1) access by quickly returning the
    value stored at the base memory address of the contiguous array.
  </p>

  <p>
    Insertion into the queue is also achieved in constant time. When the
    <code>enqueue</code> method calls <code>append</code> on
    <code>self._items</code>, under the hood, Python is able to jump directly to
    the end of the underlying contiguous array that implements
    <code>self._items</code>. Thus, we can achieve O(1) constant
    time-complexity.
  </p>
  <p>
    As mentioned in the previous section, our current implementation of the
    queue is inefficient for deleting data. To delete data, we rely on the
    <code>dequeue</code> method, which calls the <code>pop</code> method of
    <code>self._items</code>. The bottleneck in our performance comes from the
    fact that <code>pop</code> has a worst-case time complexity of O(n). This is
    because deleting the first element from a contiguous array requires shifting
    the remaining n-1 values to the left in order to maintain the contiguous
    memory storage used by Python's List implementation.
  </p>
  <p>
    The slow deletion process also affects our ability to search through the
    queue. Since we only have access to the first element in the queue, we have
    to dequeue each element until we find the value we are searching for. In the
    worst-case scenario, the element we are looking for is not in the queue, and
    we will have dequeued all n elements. Given that dequeuing is an O(n)
    operation, and we have n elements in the queue, we can expect searching to
    have a worst-case time complexity of O(n*n) = O(n<sup>2</sup>).
  </p>
  <hr />
  <h4>Improving Our Queue Implementation</h4>
  <p>
    Our current queue implementation suffers from slow deletion and search
    operations. Fortunately, there are a few ways to improve it. One option is
    to use a linked list instead of Python's built-in list. Unlike Python's
    built-in list, linked lists allow for deletion of the first element without
    shifting the remaining n-1 elements. However, since linked lists have not
    been covered in this series, we won't dive into this solution just yet.
  </p>
  <p>
    Alternatively, we could simply delete the first element in the array without
    shifting the remaining n-1 elements, which would reduce our time complexity
    to O(1). However, this would cause another issue of wasting too much memory.
    If we don't shift the remaining n-1 elements, the underlying array for our
    queue would have a large amount of unused space allocated in the front. To
    remedy this issue, we can implement the queue using a circular array. A
    circular array is an array data structure that uses
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic"
      >modular arithmetic</a
    >
    to wrap around to the beginning of the array when it reaches the end. This
    approach allows us to reuse the empty space at the beginning of the array
    without shifting elements as they are dequeued, effectively making the array
    circular. With this approach, we can achieve constant time-complexity for
    both insertion and deletion operations, making the queue more efficient
    overall.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using either of the alternate implementations described above we can reduce
    deletion to O(1) and search to O(n) time-complexity. If this doesn't make
    sense at this point, don't worry. We are going to cover circular arrays in
    detail and use them to improve our queue implementation in the next post.
  </p>

  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>
    In this article, we explored the concept of queues and a simple
    implementation. We learned that queues are a powerful tool for managing data
    structures in a first-in, first-out (FIFO) order. We also saw that Python's
    built-in list data type can be used to implement a queue, but the resulting
    implementation suffers from slow deletion and search operations. To improve
    performance, we discussed the use of linked lists and circular arrays for
    alternative implementations for queues. In the next post, we will build upon
    the idea of a circular array and use it to improve the performance of our
    <code>SimpleQueue</code> implementation.
