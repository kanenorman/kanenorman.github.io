  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>
    In the
    <a href="{{'/programming/simple-sorting' | relative_url}}">
      previous post</a
    >
    , we discussed three simple sorting algorithms: bubble sort, selection sort,
    and insertion sort. Although all of these algorithms have a worst-case time
    complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>), we acknowledged that insertion sort is the
    most efficient among them. This is because the algorithm is designed in a
    way that allows for fewer comparisons to be made with each iteration. As a
    result, insertion sort performs relatively better than the other simple
    sorting algorithms, particularly when the array is already almost sorted.
  </p>

  <p>
    Consider this example where the element is only slightly out of place. We
    would only have to copy and shift a single element to sort the entire array.
    Thus, insertion sort would preform pretty efficiently.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center; font-size: x-large">
    [ 2, <span style="color: red"><u>1</u></span
    >, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]
  </p>
  <p>
    Now consider the following example where the smallest element is on the far
    right of the array. In this scenario, we would have to shift and copy all
    elements to sort a single value. As a general rule, insertion sort becomes
    less efficient when small values are located on the far right, requiring
    many shift operations to sort an element.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center; font-size: x-large">
    [ 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, <span style="color: red"><u>1</u></span> ]
  </p>
  <p>
    As we've seen, the efficiency of insertion sort depends on how close the
    array is to being sorted. When the array is close to being sorted, insertion
    sort performs efficiently with a time complexity closer to O(n). However, in
    the worst-case scenario where the array is in reverse order, the time
    complexity becomes O(n<sup>2</sup>). The inefficiency arises when the
    elements are located far from their final position, requiring the shifting
    of many intermediate elements.
  </p>
  <p>
    To avoid the inefficiencies that may arise in insertion sort, we can use
    shell sort as an alternative. The algorithm is an extension of insertion
    sort that first sorts elements spaced far apart before sorting elements that
    are close together. This approach enables the algorithm to quickly move
    elements that are far from their correct position closer to their sorted
    position, without requiring the shifting of a large number of intermediate
    elements. Consequently, shell sort can significantly improve the speed and
    efficiency of the sorting process.
  </p>

  <h4>Shell Sort</h4>
  <p>
    The shell sort algorithm starts by sorting elements that are spaced far
    apart using a certain gap sequence "h". In each iteration, the gap is
    reduced until it reaches one. This way, the algorithm can quickly move
    elements that are far from their correct position closer to their sorted
    position. Once the gap is reduced to one, the algorithm performs a standard
    insertion sort on the entire array, which is now close to being sorted. This
    approach leads to a faster sorting process compared to insertion sort
    because elements are moved closer to their final position more quickly.

  <p>
    In order to effectively implement the shell sort algorithm, it's important
    to grasp the concept of a gap sequence. The gap sequence defines the spacing
    between the elements being compared during each iteration of the algorithm.
    There are various choices for gap sequences and each sequence leads to
    various time-complexities. There has been extensive research conducted on
    each variation, and if you're interested in diving deeper into the topic, I
    highly encourage you to do so. However, for the purpose of keeping this post
    concise and easy to follow, we will be utilizing the Knuth Sequence for the
    implementation of shell sort.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Knuth sequence is a sequence of integers defined recursively by the
    formula:
    <span class="math inline">
      <em>h<sub>i</sub></em> = 3<em>h<sub>i-1</sub></em> + 1
    </span>
    where
    <span class="math inline"
      ><em>h<sub>0</sub></em> = 1</span
    >. The first several terms of the sequence are 1, 4, 13, 40, 121, 364, and
    1093. It's important to note that you should only use values of
    <em>h<sub>i</sub></em> that are less than the size of your array. For
    example, if your array has 500 elements, you should only use values of
    <em>h<sub>i</sub></em> up to 364.
  </p>

  <p>
    Below is an implementation of the algorithm in Python. You will notice that
    it is essentially the same as insertion sort, but includes the gap sequence
    described above.
  </p>
  <pre>
  {%highlight python%}
def shell_sort(array):
  n = len(array)
  knuth = lambda h: 3 * h + 1
  inverse_knuth = lambda h: (h - 1) // 3

  # build Knuth sequence
  h = 1
  while knuth(h) < n:
      h = knuth(h)

  while h > 0:
      for outer in range(h, n):
          value = array[outer]
          inner = outer

          # same logic as insertion sort
          while inner >= h and value < array[inner - h]:
              array[inner] = array[inner - h]
              inner -= h

          array[inner] = value

      # decrement the gap
      h = inverse_knuth(h)
  {%endhighlight%}
  </pre>

  <p>
    The average complexity of this algorithm is rather complex to derive. For
    now, just know the implementation that is shown above has an average run
    time complexity of O(n(log(n))<sup>2</sup>), and a worst-case complexity of
    O(n<sup>3/2</sup>).

  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>
    In conclusion, while insertion sort is an efficient algorithm, its
    performance drops when sorting large arrays that are not close to being
    sorted. To mitigate this issue, we can use shell sort, which is an extension
    of insertion sort. Shell sort improves the efficiency of the sorting process
    by first sorting elements that are spaced far apart before sorting those
    that are close together. This approach enables the algorithm to quickly move
    elements that are far from their correct position closer to their sorted
    position, without requiring the shifting of a large number of intermediate
    elements. The choice of gap sequence can significantly impact the efficiency
    of the algorithm, and the Knuth sequence is a commonly used sequence. The
    implementation of shell sort may be slightly more complex than insertion
    sort, but it's a powerful algorithm that can sort medium to large arrays
    pretty efficiently.
