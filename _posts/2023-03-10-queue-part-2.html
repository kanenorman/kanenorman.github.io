  <h4>Introduction</h4>

  <p>
    In our previous post, we created a simple queue using Python's built-in list
    object. However, we mentioned that using the list's <code>pop</code> method
    to dequeue items caused performance issues. This is because , in Python's C
    source code, the list object is implemented using a contiguous array, so
    calling <code>pop</code> on the first element requires shifting all
    remaining n-1 elements to maintain the array's continuity. As a result, our
    previous implementation of <code>dequeue</code> had a time-complexity of
    O(n).
  </p>
  <pre>
{%highlight python%}
def dequeue(self) -> Any:
    if self.is_empty():
        raise Exception("Can not dequeue empty queue")
    else:
        return self._items.pop(0) # this is an O(n) operation
{%endhighlight%}

  </pre>

  <p>
    In this post, we will start by introducing modular arithmetic and circular
    arrays. Then, we will demonstrate how we can use these concepts to
    significantly improve the performance of our <code>dequeue</code> operation,
    reducing its time-complexity to O(1).

  <h4>Modular Arithmetic</h4>
  <p>
    Modular arithmetic is a type of arithmetic that deals with remainders when
    dividing by a certain number, called the modulus. In modular arithmetic,
    numbers "wrap around" to the start after reaching the modulus value. An
    example to illustrate this is a clock, which has 12 hours. Once we reach
    hour 12, we "wrap around" and begin counting at hour 1 again.

  </div>

  <p>
    In Python, we can perform modular arithmetic using the
    <code>%</code> (modulo) operator. When we write <code>foo % bar</code> in
    Python, the <code>%</code> operator returns the remainder when
    <code>foo</code> is divided by <code>bar</code>. For instance, if we execute
    <code>15 % 12 </code>, the result will be 3 because when we divide 15 by 12,
    we get a quotient of 1 with a remainder of 3. To illustrate this with the
    clock example, if we count up to 15 hours, we would pass 12 and wrap back
    around to hour 3.
  </p>

  <h4>Circular Arrays</h4>
  <p>
    Circular arrays are a type of data structure that share many similarities
    with linear arrays. However, there is a key difference: when we reach the
    end of a circular array, we start over at the beginning and "wrap around" to
    the front. This wrapping around feature has a significant advantage over
    linear arrays: it allows us to make use of any unused space at the beginning
    of the array. In a linear array, any unused space at the beginning is
    effectively wasted and cannot be used for storage. But in a circular array,
    we can still use this space by wrapping around to the front of the array
    when we reach the end.
  </p>
  <p>
    For instance, consider a fixed-length array with 5 elements, where the first
    three elements are empty, and the last two elements are occupied. If we want
    to insert an additional item, say, <code>baz</code>, into the array, we can
    use the empty space in the front. We can continue to use the remaining empty
    space in the front until all the unused space is occupied. This can be
    illustrated as follows:
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center; font-size: x-large">
    <code>[ _, _, _, foo, bar ]</code>
    <br />
    <code>[ baz, _, _, foo, bar ]</code>
    <br />
    <code>[ baz, buzz, _, foo, bar ]</code>
    <br />
    <code>[ baz, buzz, spam, foo, bar ]</code>
  </p>

  <p>
    Implementing a circular array can be slightly more challenging than
    implementing a linear array. In a linear array, we know that the starting
    index is always zero and the ending index is n-1, where n is the length of
    the array. However, to implement a circular array, we need to keep track of
    two pointers: a front and a rear index. We use the front index to keep track
    of where the first element of the array is located, and we use the rear
    index to keep track of where the next element should be inserted.
  </p>
  <p>
    When we add an element to a circular array, we insert it at the rear index
    and then move the rear index one position forward. When we remove an element
    from a circular array, we remove it from the front index and move the front
    index one position forward. By using these two pointers, we can effectively
    implement a circular array data structure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, we must use modular arithmetic to wrap around to the front of
    the circular array when the rear pointer exceeds n-1. For example, let's say
    we have a circular array of length 5 and the rear index is currently 4
    (meaning the last element is occupied). If we try to insert a new element,
    we would normally increment the rear index to 5, but this is outside the
    bounds of the array. Instead, we use modular arithmetic to calculate the new
    position of the rear index: (4 + 1) % 5 = 0. This means that the rear index
    should "wrap around" to the front of the array, and the new element should
    be inserted at index 0. Similarly, when we remove an element from the front
    of the array and increment the front index, we must also use modular
    arithmetic to wrap around to the front of the array if the front index
    exceeds n-1.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using modular arithmetic in this way allows us to effectively implement the
    wrapping around feature of circular arrays and make use of any unused space
    at the beginning of the array.
  </p>

  <h4>Circular Queue</h4>
  <p>
    Our previous implementation of a queue suffered from an inefficient dequeue
    operation. This was because every time we called pop to remove an element
    from the front of the queue, we had to shift all the remaining elements one
    position to the left, which resulted in a time-complexity of O(n). As an
    alternative solution, we suggested that we could continue using a linear
    data structure such as a Python built-in list, but avoid shifting elements
    after we deleted them from the front. This would improve the dequeue
    operation's time-complexity to O(1), but we noted that this approach would
    waste space by leaving unused memory at the front of our queue.
  </p>
  <p>
    To achieve an O(1) time-complexity dequeue without wasting space, we can use
    a circular array. In a circular queue, we avoid shifting items and utilize
    any unused space in the circular array by wrapping around to the front. This
    eliminates the need for the time-consuming operation of shifting all
    elements to the front of the array, resulting in an O(1) time-complexity.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're not clear on this concept, don't worry. We'll use our abstract
    base class and walk through a step-by-step implementation of a circular
    queue to help you understand it better.
  </p>
  <p>
    To implement a circular queue, we will define a new class called
    <code>CircularQueue</code>. This class will inherit from the
    <code>AbstractQueue</code> class that we defined in the previous post. When
    we initialize a new <code>CircularQueue</code> object, we need to provide
    one parameter, <code>max_size</code>, which represents the size of our
    circular array. In our <code>__init__</code> method, we will define a few
    attributes for our class. First, we will create a circular array called
    <code>_items</code>. We will also define two pointers,
    <code>_front</code> and <code>_rear</code>, which will keep track of the
    front and rear of our circular array. Finally, we will create an attribute
    called <code>_number_items</code> which will keep track of the number of
    items in the queue.
  </p>
  <pre>
{% highlight python %}
class CircularQueue(AbstractQueue):
    def __init__(self, max_size: int) -> None:
        self._max_size: int = max_size
        self._items: List[Any] = [None] * max_size
        self._number_items: int = 0
        self._front: int = 0
        self._rear: int = -1
{% endhighlight %}
  </pre>
  <p>
    To implement a circular queue, we need to implement the four abstract
    methods defined by our <code>AbstractQueue</code> . Additionally, we must
    implement a method to check if the queue is full, since our circular array
    is restricted to a maximum size of <code>max_size</code>.
  </p>
  <pre>
{% highlight python %}
def is_full(self) -> bool:
    return self._number_items == self._max_size
{% endhighlight %}
  </pre>

  <p>
    Now, we begin implement our abstract methods, starting with the
    <code>is_empty</code> method, which simply checks the
    <code>_number_items</code> attribute and tells us if the queue contains any
    elements.
  </p>
  <pre>
{% highlight python %}
def is_empty(self) -> bool:
    return self._number_items == 0
{% endhighlight %}
</pre
  >
  <p>
    Moving on, let's implement the <code>enqueue</code> method. In a queue, we
    add new items to the rear, so we need to use our <code>_rear</code> pointer
    to locate the correct position in our circular array. Before inserting new
    values, we should always check that the queue is not full to avoid
    overflowing.
  </p>

  <pre>
{% highlight python %}
def enqueue(self, new_item: Any) -> None:
    if self.is_full():
        raise Exception("Can not insert new items into full queue")
    else:
        self._rear = (self._rear + 1) % self._max_size
        self._items[self._rear] = new_item
        self._number_items += 1
{% endhighlight %}
</pre
  >
  <p>
    The <code>dequeue</code> method follows a similar logic. We begin by
    checking that the queue is not empty. Then, we make a copy of the front
    item, free up the space used by it, shift the front pointer by one position,
    decrement the number of items in the queue, and finally return the copy we
    made of the front item.
  </p>
  <pre>
{% highlight python %}
def dequeue(self) -> Any:
    if self.is_empty():
        raise Exception("Can not remove from empty queue")
    else:
        front_copy = self._items[self._front]
        self._items[self._front] = None
        self._front = (self._front + 1) % self._max_size
        self._number_items -= 1
        return front_copy
{% endhighlight %}
</pre
  >
  <p>
    The <code>peek</code> method is similar to <code>dequeue</code> except we
    don't remove the element at the front of the queue, we simply return it.
  </p>
  <pre>
{% highlight python %}
def peek(self) -> Any:
    if self.is_empty():
        raise Exception("Can not peek into  empty queue")
    else:
        return self._items[self._front] 
{% endhighlight %}
</pre
  >
  <p>
    To finish our class, we can implement two dunder methods
    <code>__len__</code> to tell us the number of elements stored in the queue
    and <code>__str__</code> to print a visual representation of the elements.
  </p>
  <pre>
{% highlight python %}
def __len__(self) -> int:
    return self._number_items

def __str__(self) -> str:
    result = ""

    # start at front and circle through all positions
    # until we reach the front again
    position = self._front
    while True:
        result += f"{self._items[position]}, "
        position = (position + 1) % self._max_size

        if position == self._front:
            break

    # remove the comma and space from the last item printed
    return result[:-2]
{% endhighlight %}
</pre

  <p>
    If we put it all together, we can create the following class to implement an
    abstract queue
  </p>

  <pre>
{% highlight python %}

  <p>
    The <code>CircularQueue</code> class offers O(1) access, insertion, and
    deletion operations. Access and insertion remain O(1) for the same reasons
    as in our <code>SimpleQueue</code> class. However, deletion is now also an
    O(1) operation, thanks to the use of a circular array. Since the front
    element can be removed without shifting the remaining n-1 elements, deleting
    an element takes constant time. Also searching is reduced from an
    O(n<sup>2</sup>) an O(n) operation because it is proportional to the time it
    takes to dequeue each element.
  </p>
  <p>
    While the circular queue offers faster operations, it does come with a
    tradeoff of a fixed size. Unlike the built-in list, which can grow or shrink
    as needed, a circular queue has a fixed capacity. This means that the queue
    can only hold a certain number of elements, and if that capacity is
    exceeded, the queue will either need to be resized or some elements will
    need to be discarded.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another implementation of the queue that offers O(1) insertion, deletion,
    and access operations is based on the linked list data structure. Unlike the
    circular queue, this implementation does not require a fixed size and can
    grow or shrink dynamically. We will explore the linked list data structure
    in an upcoming post and show how it can be used to implement a queue.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>
    In conclusion, the circular queue is a powerful data structure that provides
    O(1) access, insertion, and deletion operations. The circular array
    implementation enables O(1) deletion without the need to shift elements,
    making it a great choice for applications where fast access and deletion are
    essential. However, the circular queue comes with a fixed capacity, which
    means it cannot accommodate a variable number of elements. Despite this
    limitation, the circular queue is still an excellent choice for applications
    where the number of elements is known in advance, and fast access and
    deletion are critical. By contrast, a implementation using Python's built-in
    list has the flexibility to grow or shrink as needed but may suffer from
    performance limitations.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the next post, we will explore priority queues, a variation of the queue
    data structure that assigns a priority to each element and allows for
    efficient access to the highest-priority element.
