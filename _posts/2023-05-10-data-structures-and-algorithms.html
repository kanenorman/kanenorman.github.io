  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>
    Data structures and algorithms are fundamental in computer science, serving
    as the building blocks for organizing, storing, and retrieving data
    efficiently. They are essential in solving various computational problems
    and creating high-performance applications; however, despite their
    importance, many developers struggle to grasp these concepts fully. This is
    partially due to the difficulty of the subject and the lack of easily
    understandable resources.
  </p>

  <p>
    My goal is to teach these subjects in a easily digestible manner. In this
    series of posts, I will provide a beginner friendly explanation to these
    concepts. It is assumed that the reader has a basic understanding of the
    Python programming language, but no prior knowledge of data structures or
    algorithms will be necessary. By the end of this series, you can expect to
    have developed a strong foundation in these concepts and be able to
    effectively apply this knowledge to write more efficient programs.

  <h4>What Are Data Structures and Algorithms?</h4>
  <p>
    A
    <span style="color: darkorange; font-weight: bold"> data structure </span>is
    a clever way of organizing and storing data, making it more accessible and
    easier to work with. Some popular examples include arrays, linked lists,
    trees, graphs, and hash tables. In general, we want a data structure to
    preform a few essential operations:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Access</span> - grab data at a specific
      position
    </li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Insert</span> - add new data</li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Delete</span> - remove existing data
    </li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Search</span> - find existing data</li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Traverse</span> - go through all data
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The code snippet below, shows an example of these operations being preformed
    on an array data structure.
  </p>

  <pre>
{% highlight python %}
from array import array

my_array = array('i', [1,2,3,4])

# Access
first_item = my_array[0]

# Insert 
my_array.insert(4,5)

# Delete 
my_array.remove(1)

# Search
index_of_three = my_array.index(3)

# Traverse
for element in my_array:
  print(element)
{% endhighlight %}
</pre
  >
  <p>
    In general, these common operations can be implemented across a ton of
    different data structures ; however, it is important to note that each type
    of data structure possess its own unique strengths and weaknesses. For
    instance, while arrays are faster for accessing data, they can be slower for
    inserting new data. Hence, it's essential to be aware of the workings of
    each data structure and to choose the appropriate one for a given task.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="color: magenta; font-weight: bold"> Algorithms</span> are the
    step-by-step procedures that are used to manipulate data in these
    structures. Some popular examples include searching, sorting, and reversing.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the code snippet below, we can see an example of an algorithm being
    preformed on our array
  </p>
  <pre>
{% highlight python %}
# Algorithm to reverse all elements in the array
my_array.reverse()
{% endhighlight %}
</pre

  <h4>Which Data Structure is the Best?</h4>
  <p>
    It is important to note that there is no universally superior data
    structure. While a data structure may excel at a specific task, it may not
    perform well for others. Hence, we will explore a variety of data structures
    and discuss their suitability for different scenarios. As a general
    guideline, it is best to consider the goals of your program first and then
    select the most appropriate data structure accordingly.
  </p>
  <p>
    This idea can be clearly demonstrated trough an example. Imagine you were
    responsible for managing a library. Which structure would you prefer for
    maintaining it: the disorganized one shown on the left, or the organized one
    depicted on the right?

  <p>
    This is a trick question because the answer depends on what your goal is! In
    the disorganized library, the checkout process would be painfully slow due
    to the time-consuming search for books. However, storing new books would be
    quick and easy, as you can place them anywhere without following a specific
    order.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, the organized library on the right would make finding a
    specific book much easier. However, storing a new book would take longer
    because you would need to adhere to the structured system, locate the
    specific spot, and potentially rearrange existing books to accommodate the
    new addition.
  </p>

  <p>
    As you can see, different methods of organization have different performance
    tradeoffs. This principle applies not only to library books but also to how
    you store data within the programs you create.

  <h4>How Do We Measure the Performance of Algorithms?</h4>
  <p>
    It can be difficult to accurately predict the exact amount of time a piece
    of code will take to run. Rather than determining a precise time, we often
    focus on understanding how an algorithm scales as the size of its input (n)
    increases. This is where Big-O notation comes in handy. Big-O notation is a
    commonly used method for measuring the performance of algorithms, by
    providing an upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's running time
    as the size of its input grows. In this way, Big-O notation helps us
    understand how the performance of an algorithm changes as the size of its
    input changes, allowing us to make informed decisions about which algorithm
    is best suited for a particular task.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many individuals who do not have a strong foundation in mathematics may find
    Big-O notation challenging to grasp. However, in this series of posts, I
    will clarify the concept of Big-O and provide clear explanations and
    relevant analogies that make it easier to understand. With a lot of practice
    and a little bit of guidance Big-O will become an easy topic to understand.
  </p>
  <p>
    For now, just know that we prefer algorithms that have a time complexity of
    O(n) or better, meaning the time required to solve a problem increases
    linearly with the size of the input, or even faster.
  </p>

  <p>
    In addition to runtime, it is crucial to assess the memory consumption of
    our algorithms, known as space complexity. Similar to time complexity, we
    are interested in understanding how the memory requirements scale with the
    size of inputs, which we can also analyze using Big-O notation. It is worth
    noting that time and space complexity often involve a
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space%E2%80%93time_tradeoff"
      target="_blank"
      >tradeoff</a
    >, allowing us to optimize the speed of our algorithms while considering
    memory usage.

  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>
    In this series of posts, I will provide a comprehensive overview of data
    structures and algorithms. The examples used in these post will be
    demonstrated in Python, but the concepts can be applied to other programming
    languages as well. I will occasionally make references to the C programming
    language to explain some low level concepts, but knowledge of the C language
    is not necessary to follow these post.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's important to clarify that this series of post assumes a strong
    foundation in programming basics such as variables, functions, classes,
    loops, etc. If you're not yet comfortable with these concepts, I highly
    recommend taking the time to build your foundation before diving into data
    structures and algorithms. Nevertheless, I'm eager to share this material
    and help you gain a deeper understanding of this important topic.
