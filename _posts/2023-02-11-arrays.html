  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>
    Arrays are one of the most commonly used data structures in programming.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <h4>Overview</h4>
  <p>
    Arrays are a collection of sequential memory addresses that store data in a
    specific format. When we create an array, as shown in the following code
    snippet, we specify the data type and the values to be stored. In this
    example, we create an 'array' of 32-bit integers with values 1, 2, 3, and 4.
    Our computer allocates enough contiguous memory to store these values in a
    sequence.
  </p>
  <pre>
{% highlight python %}
from array import array

my_array = array('i', [1,2,3,4])
{% endhighlight%}
</pre

  <p>
    The significance of storing values in contiguous memory lies in the fact
    that it enables fast access to the values in an array. With the knowledge of
    the address of the first element and the uniformity of each element's size
    in terms of bits, finding the address of any element can be achieved through
    simple arithmetic operations, specifically, addition.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is an example to make this clear. Consider array of integers, where
    each integer takes 4 bytes of memory. If the first integer is stored at
    address 1000, the second integer would be stored at address 1004 (since 1000
    + 4 = 1004), the third integer would be stored at address 1008, and so on.
    As you can see, the memory addresses of each integer are contiguous, meaning
    they are in a sequential order. This makes it easy for the computer to
    locate any element in the array by simply adding the size of one element (4
    bytes in this case) to the starting address.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, if the elements in the array were stored in
    non-contiguous memory, the computer would have to do more work to find the
    address of each element, which would slow down the access time.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <h4>Pros and Cons</h4>
  <p>
    Arrays offer speedy access to elements due to the contiguous memory
    allocation, as explained earlier. This allows the computer to quickly locate
    any element in the array by simply adding the size of one element to the
    starting address.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, arrays have some limitations when it comes to searching and sorting
    operations. Unlike other data structures arrays are not designed
    specifically for these tasks and can result in slow and inefficient
    algorithms for searching and sorting.
  </p>
  <hr />
  <h4>Ordered Arrays And Binary Search</h4>
  <p>
    An ordered array is a type of array that maintains elements in a specific
    order, either ascending or descending. The advantage of an ordered array
    lies in its ability to make searching for elements more efficient and
    faster. Imagine searching for a specific card in a deck of cards. It would
    be easier and quicker to find the desired card in a sorted deck, compared to
    an unsorted one.
  </p>
  <p>
    In arrays, this concept can be leveraged by using algorithms that take
    advantage of the order of the elements to speed up the search process. One
    such algorithm is the binary search algorithm, which is widely used for
    searching in ordered arrays. The binary search algorithm works by dividing
    the array into smaller subintervals until the desired element is found. With
    each iteration, the number of elements is halved, making it possible to
    quickly find the target element.
  </p>
  <p>
    Heres a quick example to illustrate binary search. Consider searching for
    the value 6 in the ordered array
  </p>

  <p style="text-align: center; font-size: x-large">[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ]</p>
  <p>
    To search for the number 6 in our ordered array, we could estimate its
    position by assuming it to be the midpoint of the array. In our example, the
    actual midpoint turns out to be 4. However, since the array is ordered, we
    know that the number 6 must be located to the right of the midpoint. This
    allows us to eliminate all elements to the left of the midpoint, and we can
    narrow down our search to the right half of the array, excluding the
    midpoint.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center; font-size: x-large">
    [ 1, 2, 3, <span style="color: red"><u>4</u></span
    >, 5, 6, 7 ]
  </p>

  <p>
    After eliminating the midpoint and left half of the array, we are left with
    three values. Once again we can estimate using the midpoint and we will see
    that in this iteration we have found the value we are looking for.
  </p>
  <p style="text-align: center; font-size: x-large">
    [ <span style="color: gray"><s>1, 2, 3, 4,</s></span> 5,
    <span style="color: red"><u>6</u></span
    >, 7 ]
  </p>
  <p>In Python, the algorithm can be implemented as such</p>
  <pre>
    {% highlight python %}
def binary_search(array, value):

    low = 0
    high = len(array) - 1

    while low <= high:
        middle = (low + high) // 2

        if array[middle] == value:
            return middle

        # if midpoint is smaller, ignore the left half
        if array[middle] < value:
            low = middle + 1

        # if midpoint is larger, ignore the right half
        if array[middle] > value:
            high = middle - 1

    # return -1 if match not found
    return -1
    {% endhighlight %}
  </pre>
  <p>
    In general, when searching for an element in an ordered array, we can
    continuously divide the array into smaller sections by selecting a midpoint
    and separating the elements into a right and left half. The process is
    repeated on the half that contains the target value until the midpoint
    becomes the value being sought.
  </p>

  <p>
    As expected, it is faster and more systematic to search for values in arrays
    that are ordered, but it comes with a trade-off. The process of inserting a
    new value into an ordered array is slower than in an unordered array, as it
    requires finding the correct position in the order before insertion can
    occur. This makes inserting new elements into an ordered array a more
    time-consuming process, but the benefit of faster searches still makes it a
    useful data structure in certain situations.
