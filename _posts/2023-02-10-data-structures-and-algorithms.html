  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>
    Data structures and algorithms are considered the foundation of computer
    science because they provide the underlying structure for organizing,
    storing, and retrieving data efficiently and effectively. They are critical
    in solving a wide range of computational problems and high performance
    applications. However, despite their importance, many developers still
    struggle with these concepts. The reality is, a deep understanding of data
    structures and algorithms is essential for writing code that is not only
    efficient and scalable, but also maintainable. In this series of blog posts,
    my goal is to provide a crash course on these concepts, making them
    accessible and understandable to all. Join me on this series of blog post as
    we demystify the exciting world of data structures and algorithms!

  <h4>What Are Data Structures and Algorithms?</h4>
  <p>
    A
    <span style="color: darkorange; font-weight: bold"> data structure </span>is
    a clever way of organizing and storing data, making it more accessible and
    easier to work with. Some popular examples include arrays, linked lists,
    trees, graphs, and hash tables. In general, we want a data structure to
    preform a few essential operations:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Access</span> - grab element at a specific
      position
    </li>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold">Insert</span> - add new element</li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Delete</span> - remove existing element
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Search</span> - find an existing element
    </li>
    <li>
      <span style="font-weight: bold">Traverse</span> - visit all elements
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The code snippet below, shows an example of these operations being preformed
    on an array.
  </p>

  <pre>
{% highlight python %}
from array import array

my_array = array('i', [1,2,3,4])

# Access
first_item = my_array[0]

# Insert 
my_array.insert(4,5)

# Delete 
my_array.remove(1)

# Search
index_of_three = my_array.index(3)

# Traverse
for element in my_array:
  print(element)
{% endhighlight %}
</pre
  >
  <p>
    In general, these common operations are implemented across different data
    structures; however, it is important to note that each data structure
    possess its own unique strengths and weaknesses. For instance, while arrays
    are faster for accessing data, they may be slower for inserting new
    elements. Hence, it's essential to be aware of the workings of each data
    structure and to choose the appropriate one for a given task.
  </p>
  <p>
    <span style="color: magenta; font-weight: bold"> Algorithms</span> are the
    step-by-step procedures that are used to manipulate data in these
    structures. Some popular examples include binary search and quick sort.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the code snippet below, we can see an example of an algorithm being
    preformed on our array
  </p>
  <pre>
{% highlight python %}
# Algorithm to reverse all elements in the array
my_array.reverse()
{% endhighlight %}
</pre

  <h4>Are Data Structures and Algorithms Important?</h4>
  <p>
    Yes, data structures and algorithms are incredibly important, particularly
    as the amount of data we work with continues to increase. Efficiently
    designed data structures and algorithms can greatly enhance the performance
    of our programs, allowing them to run more quickly and smoothly. Just as
    organizing a file cabinet or structuring class notes can bring benefits to
    performance and efficiency, so too does a well-designed program, built using
    appropriate data structures and algorithms.
  </p>

  <h4>How Do We Measure Performance?</h4>
  <p>
    It can be difficult to accurately predict the exact amount of time a piece
    of code will take to run. Rather than determining a precise time, we often
    focus on understanding how an algorithm scales as the size of its input (n)
    increases. This is where Big-O notation comes in handy. Big-O notation is a
    commonly used method for measuring the performance of algorithms, by
    providing an upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's running time
    as the size of its input grows. In this way, Big-O notation helps us
    understand how the performance of an algorithm changes as the size of its
    input changes, allowing us to make informed decisions about which algorithm
    is best suited for a particular task.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many individuals who do not have a strong foundation in mathematics may find
    Big-O notation challenging to grasp. However, in this series of posts, I
    will clarify the concept of Big-O and provide clear explanations and
    relevant analogies that make it easier to understand. With a lot of practice
    and a little bit of guidance Big-O will become an easy topic to understand.

  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>
    In this series of posts, I will provide a comprehensive overview of data
    structures and algorithms. The examples used in these post will be
    demonstrated in Python, but the concepts can be applied to other programming
    languages as well. It's important to note that this series of post assumes a
    strong foundation in programming basics such as variables, functions,
    classes, loops, etc. If you're not yet comfortable with these concepts, I
    highly recommend taking the time to build your foundation before diving into
    data structures and algorithms. Nevertheless, I'm eager to share this
    material and help you gain a deeper understanding of this important topic.
