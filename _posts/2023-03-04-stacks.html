  <h4>Introduction</h4>
  <p>
    In our previous discussions, we explored the array data structure and its
    usefulness for storing data in an integer-based index system. Arrays are
    usefull; however, there are scenarios where other data structures are more
    appropriate, particularly when we need to prioritize the most recently added
    data. In this post, we will introduce a new data structure called a
    <span style="color: darkorange; font-weight: bold">Stack</span> that is
    specifically designed for this task.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unlike arrays, which provide access to all of its elements using an index,
    stacks only allow access to the most recently added element. By doing so,
    stacks provide easy retrieval and modification of the most recently added
    data. Stacks are commonly used in programming and computer science,
    especially in applications that require backtracking. Some common examples
    include parsing expressions and implementing undo/redo functionality.
  </p>

  <h4>Stacks and LIFO</h4>
  <p>
    A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)
    principle. This means that the most recently added element is the first one
    to be removed. A great analogy for understanding stacks is to imagine a deck
    of cards. If you stack them on a table face up, you can only see the top
    card. If you add a new card to the deck, you can only see the most recent
    card you added, and any time you want to access a specific card, you have to
    remove cards from the top until you find the card you are looking for. This
    is how a stack data structure works; we only have access to the top item,
    and any time we add a new item, we add it to the top.

  <h4>Stack Operations</h4>
  <p>
    Stacks provide restricted access to their data, allowing only the most
    recently added item to be accessed at the top of the stack. This limited
    access results in only three primary operations that can be performed on a
    stack:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>push:</b> add a new value to the top of the stack</li>

    <li><b>pop:</b> remove and return the top element of the stack</li>

    <li>
      <b>peek:</b> return the top element of the stack, but don't remove it.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Using the deck of cards analogy, pushing would be equivalent to adding a new
    card to the top of the deck, popping would be equivalent to drawing the top
    card from the deck, and peeking would be equivalent to taking a quick look
    at the top card without removing it from the deck.
  </p>

  <h4>Implementation</h4>
  <p>
    The Python
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html">queue</a> module
    provides a built-in stack data structure called <code>LifoQueue</code>.
    However, for the purpose of learning, we will focus on implementing a stack
    from scratch and explaining it step by step. There are different ways to
    implement the data structure, but we will use a simple implementation that
    uses the concepts discussed in this and previous posts.
  </p>
  <p>
    To start, we will create a class called <code>Stack</code> that accepts one
    parameter for initialization, <code>max_size</code>. This parameter simply
    specifies the maximum number of elements that the stack can contain. In our
    <code>__init__</code> method, we will create two instance attributes:
    <code>_stack_items</code> which stores the elements in our stack, and
    <code>_top</code> which represents the index of the top element in
    <code>_stack_items</code>.
  </p>
  <pre>
{% highlight python %}
class Stack:
    def __init__(self, max_size):
        self._stack_items = [None] * max_size
        self._top = -1
{% endhighlight %}
  </pre>
  <p>
    In addition to the above initialization, we will implement two helper
    methods
    <code>is_empty</code> and <code>is_full</code> that let us know if the stack
    is empty or full. These methods use our <code>_top</code> attribute to check
    whether the stack is empty or full, respectively.
  </p>
  <pre>
{% highlight python %}
def is_empty(self) -> bool:
    return self._top < 0

def is_full(self) -> bool:
    return self._top >= len(self._stack_items) - 1
{% endhighlight %}
</pre
  >

  <p>
    Next, we will implement the three core functionalities of a stack: push,
    pop, and peek. We will start with the <code>push</code> method. The
    implementation is relatively simple. First, we check if the stack is already
    full. If it is, we raise an exception; otherwise, we increment the top
    pointer by one and use it to place our new item in the stack list.
  </p>
  <pre>
{% highlight python %}
def push(self, new_item: Any) -> None:
    if not self.is_full():
        self._top += 1
        self._stack_items[self._top] = new_item
    else:
        raise Exception("Cannot push to a full stack.")
{% endhighlight %}
</pre
  >
  <p>
    The <code>pop</code> method follows similar logic but is slightly more
    complicated since we have to save a copy of the top value before removing it
    from the stack. First, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, we raise an
    exception; otherwise, we create a copy of the top item by assigning it to a
    variable called <code>top_copy</code>. Then we replace the value at the top
    index in the <code>_stack_items</code> with None to remove it from the
    stack. Once the item is removed, we decrement the <code>_top</code> pointer
    index by one and return the copy of the original top item that we removed.
  </p>

  <pre>
{% highlight python %}
def pop(self) -> Any:
    if not self.is_empty():
        top_copy = self._stack_items[self._top]
        self._stack_items[self._top] = None
        self._top -= 1
        return top_copy
    else:
        raise Exception("Cannot pop value from empty stack")
{% endhighlight %}
  </pre>

  <p>
    The <code>peek</code> method is the simplest of the three to implement. It
    involves accessing and returning the value stored at the
    <code>_top</code> pointer index, provided the stack is not empty. Otherwise,
    we raise an exception as before.
  </p>
  <pre>
{% highlight python %}
def peek(self) -> Any:
    if not self.is_empty():
        return self._stack_items[self._top]
    else:
        raise Exception("Cannot peek into an empty stack")
{% endhighlight %}

</pre
  >

  <p>
    Finally, we will implement two dunder methods to finish our class
    <code>__len__</code> to tell us the number of elements stored in the stack
    and <code>__str__</code> to print a visual representation of the elements.
  </p>

  <pre>
{% highlight python %}
def __len__(self) -> int:
    return self._top + 1

def __str__(self) -> str:
    result = ""

    for index in range(self._top, -1, -1):
        if index == self._top:
            result += f"{self._stack_items[index]} <-- TOP\n"
        else:
            result += f"{self._stack_items[index]}\n"

    return result.rstrip() + "\n"
{% endhighlight %}


</pre

  <p>
    Putting it all together, the following implementation shows one way to
    implement a stack using a Python List object. However, it's important to
    note that this is not the only way to implement a stack. Another common
    implementation uses a singly linked list.
  </p>

  <pre>
  {% highlight python %}

    def __init__(self, max_size):
        self._stack_items = [None] * max_size
        self._top = -1

        """Adds new item to the top of the stack

        Args:

        if not self.is_full():
            self._top += 1
            self._stack_items[self._top] = new_item
        else:
            raise Exception("Cannot push to full stack")

    def pop(self) -> Any:
        """Removes and returns top value from the stack

        Raises:

        if not self.is_empty():
            top_copy = self._stack_items[self._top]
            self._stack_items[self._top] = None
            self._top -= 1
            return top_copy
        else:
            raise Exception("Cannot pop value from empty stack")

    def peek(self) -> Any:
        """View top value on stack without removing

        Raises:
            Exception: Raised if attempting to peek into empty stack
        """
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self._stack_items[self._top]
        else:
            raise Exception("Cannot peek into empty stack")

    def is_empty(self) -> bool:
        return self._top < 0

    def is_full(self) -> bool:

    def __str__(self) -> str:

            if index == self._top:
                result += f"{self._stack_items[index]} <-- TOP\n"
            else:
                result += f"{self._stack_items[index]}\n"

        return result.rstrip() + "\n"

    Stacks provide fast access to the top element, making insertion, removal,
    and access O(1) algorithms. However, this fast and restricted access means
    that searching through a stack can be slow. In the worst-case scenario, we
    may need to pop off all n elements in the stack to find the desired value,
    resulting in a O(n) worst-case time complexity for searching.
  </p>

  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p>
    In conclusion, a stack is a simple and efficient data structure that follows
    the LIFO principle. It has three core functionalities: push, pop, and peek.
    While the access, insert, and deletion operations in a stack have a time
    complexity of O(1), searching in a stack is not efficient, with a worst-case
    time complexity of O(n). Nonetheless, stacks remain widely used due to their
    simplicity, versatility, and efficiency in many applications. By
    understanding the basic concepts and operations of a stack, we can better
    design and implement algorithms that rely on this data structure.
