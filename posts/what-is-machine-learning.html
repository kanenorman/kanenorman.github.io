  <!--WHAT IS ML-->

    <h2>What is Machine Learning? ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è</h2>
    <p>
      Truthfully, it depends on who you ask. To some, it's a mysterious black box capable
      of solving any problem. For academics, it's a complex interplay of advanced mathematics and statistics. For
      skeptics, it signals the end of
      the world, with Terminator robots soon coming to end humanity! Regardless of the perspective, at its core, machine
      learning is about creating algorithms that <strong>identify patterns in data and make predictions based on those
        patterns</strong>.<sup>[1]</sup> <i>(Not too different from how humans learn from experience, right?)</i>
    </p>
  </div>

  <!--ML TYPES-->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Types of Machine Learning üîç</h2>
    <p>
      Different datasets and problems require different types of learning.<sup>[2]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this introduction, we will focus on <strong>supervised learning</strong>. Supervised learning involves training
      models using labeled data to predict or classify outcomes. For instance, a spam email classifier learns patterns
      from a dataset of emails labeled as "spam" or "not spam" to classify new, unseen emails. Essentially,
      supervised learning builds a model that understands the relationship between input features and known outcomes,
      which it then uses to make predictions on new data.

      Imagine you've gathered data on the height and weight of an alien species. Your goal is to develop a machine
      learning model to predict an alien's weight based on their height.

        <h2>Visualizing the Dataset üìà</h2>
        <p>
          When we visualize this data, a clear pattern emerges: as height increases, weight also increases in a roughly
          linear manner.
          <strong>We can train a machine to learn this pattern and make accurate predictions based on the pattern it
            learned.</strong>

        <h2>Finding the Optimal Parameters üß≠</h2>
        <p>
          Our data exhibits a linear relationship where \( \text{weight} \approx w_0 + w_1 \times \text{height} \). But
          how
          do we determine the optimal values of \( w_0 \) and \( w_1 \)? With an infinite number of possible lines, it
          would take forever to guess and check until we found the best fit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately, we don't need to do this manually. We can use supervised learning
          to automatically learn the optimal values of \( w_0 \) and \( w_1 \).

          How does the machine learn the parameters \( w_0 \) and \( w_1 \)?
        </p>
        <p>
          To begin, we define a metric to measure the model's error. Initially, the model assigns random values to \(
          w_0 \) and \( w_1 \).
          Through iterative adjustments, the algorithm aims to <span style="color: #ff0000; font-weight: bold">minimize
            this error</span> between its predictions and the actual data. <sup>[3]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          As the model minimizes this error, it effectively learns the underlying linear relationship in our data. This
          process results
          in a <span class="keyword">linear regression</span> model capable of predicting weight based on height.

  <!--A MATH PERSEPECTIVE-->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>A Mathematician's Perspective on Supervised Learning üßÆ</h2>
    <p>
      From a mathematical standpoint, supervised learning follows a structured process. To illustrate, let's consider a
      regression problem similar to our example, where the objective is to predict a continuous output \( y \) based on
      an input \( x \).
    </p>
    <h4>The Supervised Learning Process <sup>[4]</sup></h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Data Collection:</strong> Collect a dataset \( D = \{(x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_N, y_N)\} \) consisting of
        pairs \( (x_i, y_i) \) where \( x_i \) are inputs and \( y_i \) are known outputs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Function Definition:</strong> Define a function \( y = f_w(x) \) that represents how \( x \) relates to
        \( y \), using parameters \( w \).
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Loss Function Formulation:</strong> Formulate a loss function \( L(w) \) to measure how well \( f_w \)
        fits the data.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Parameter Optimization:</strong> Optimize the parameters \( w \) by minimizing the loss function \( L(w)
        \) to make \( f_w \) fit the data as accurately as possible.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This framework is versatile and widely applicable in supervised learning. It encompasses not only simple linear
      regression but also extends to advanced models like neural networks. Mastering this workflow equips you to
      effectively address nearly any supervised learning problem. If it doesn't make sense just yet, don't worry! As you
      encounter it more, you'll gradually grasp the concept.

  <!-- SUMMARY -->
  <div class="section">

        <h2>Summary ü§ì</h2>
        <p>
          Machine learning, at its core, involves creating algorithms that can identify patterns in data and make
          predictions based on those patterns. In our exploration, we've focused on supervised learning, where models
          are trained using labeled data to predict outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We began by visualizing a dataset where height and weight data exhibited a clear linear relationship. Through
          supervised learning, specifically linear regression, we demonstrated how machines learn to fit a linear
          equation \(weight \approx w_0 + w_1 \times height\) to predict weight based on height.
        </p>
        <p>
          The training process involves defining a metric to measure model error, initializing parameters \(w_0\) and
          \(w_1\),
          and iteratively adjusting them to minimize prediction errors. This iterative refinement allows the model to
          learn the underlying patterns effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          By grasping these foundational concepts and processes, you can dive
          deeper into supervised learning
          applications, ranging from simple linear regression to more intricate algorithms like neural networks. These
          concepts form a common thread throughout various machine learning methodologies.
