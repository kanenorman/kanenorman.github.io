  <!--WHAT IS ML-->
  <div class="section">
    <h4>What is Machine Learning? ðŸ¤”</h4>
    <p>
      Truthfully, it depends on who you ask. To some, it's a mysterious black
      box that can magically answer any question. For academics, it's advanced
      math that can mimic human decision-making. For skeptics, it signals the
      end of the world, with Terminator robots coming to end humanity!
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of how you define it, at its core, machine learning revolves
      around creating algorithms that are designed to
      <span class="keyword"
        >identify patterns in data and make predictions based on those
        patterns</span
      >. <sup>[1]</sup> <i>(Not too different from how humans learn, right?)</i>
    </p>
  </div>

  <!--ML TYPES-->
  <div class="section">
    <h4>Types of Machine Learning</h4>
    <p>
      Different kinds of datasets and problems lend themselves to different
      types of learning <sup>[2]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="keyword">Supervised Learning:</span> Algorithms are trained
      on labeled data where the desired output is known. For example, in a spam
      email classifier, the algorithm learns from emails labeled as "spam" or
      "not spam" to predict the label of new, unlabeled emails.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="keyword">Unsupervised Learning:</span> Involves algorithms
      learning patterns from data without explicit labels. The goal is to
      explore the structure of the data, such as clustering similar data points
      together or reducing the dimensionality of the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="keyword">Reinforcement Learning:</span> Is about training
      agents to make sequences of decisions by interacting with an environment.
      The agent learns to achieve a certain goal through trial and error,
      receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will primarily focus on supervised learning, where the emphasis is on
      training models with labeled data to make accurate predictions or
      classifications.

  <div class="section">
    <h4>Supervised Learning: A Gentle Example</h4>
    <p>
      Imagine you have collected 50 measurements for height and weight. You want
      to build a machine learning model to predict a subject's weight given
      their height.
    </p>
    <table class="striped">

  <!--SCATTER PLOT-->

        <p>
          When we plot this data, a clear pattern emerges: as height increases,
          weight increases in a roughly linear manner. This fundamental
          observation underscores the core principal of machine learning,
          <span class="keyword">
            identify patterns in data and make predictions based on those
            patterns
          </span>
          <sup>[1]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          Given our labeled data, we can employ a supervised learning algorithm
          to understand and model this linear pattern effectively.
        </p>

  <!--LINEAR REGRESSION PLOT-->
  <div class="section">
    <div class="grid">
      <div id="linear-regression-plot"></div>
      <div>
        <p>
          The question now is, how does the machine learn this linear pattern?
          We know the model needs to learn a linear equation in the form \( y =
          B_0 + B_1x \). But how does the model find the optimal parameters \(
          B_0 \) and \( B_1 \)?
        </p>
        <p>
          Without diving too far into the details just yet, the algorithm starts
          with random initial values and iteratively adjusts the parameters to
          minimize the error between the model's predictions and the actual
          labeled data.
        </p>
        <p>
          By learning this linear pattern from our data, we can train a model
          that predicts weight based on height.. The resulting line is known as
          a
          <span class="keyword">linear regression</span> model.
