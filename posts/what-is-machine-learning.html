  <!--WHAT IS ML-->
  <div class="section">
    <h4>What is Machine Learning? ðŸ¤”</h4>
    <p>
      Truthfully, it depends on who you ask. To some, it's a mysterious black
      box that can magically answer any question. For academics, it's advanced
      math that can mimic human decision-making. For skeptics, it signals the
      end of the world, with Terminator robots poised to end humanity!
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of ones perspective, at its core, machine learning revolves
      around creating algorithms that are designed to
      <span class="keyword"
        >identify patterns in data and make decisions based on those
        patterns</span
      >. <sup>[1]</sup> (Not too different from how humans learn, right?)
    </p>
  </div>

  <!--ML TYPES-->
  <div class="section">
    <h4>Types of Machine Learning</h4>
    <p>
      Machine learning algorithms can be categorized into different paradigms
      based on how they learn from and process data. <sup>[2]</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="keyword">Supervised Learning:</span> Algorithms are trained
      on labeled data where the desired output is known. For example, in a spam
      email classifier, the algorithm learns from emails labeled as "spam" or
      "not spam" to predict the label of new, unlabeled emails.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="keyword">Unsupervised Learning:</span> Involves algorithms
      learning patterns from data without explicit labels. The goal is to
      explore the structure of the data, such as clustering similar data points
      together or reducing the dimensionality of the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="keyword">Reinforcement Learning:</span> Is about training
      agents to make sequences of decisions by interacting with an environment.
      The agent learns to achieve a certain goal through trial and error,
      receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will primarily focus on supervised learning, where the emphasis is on
      training models with labeled data to make accurate predictions or
      classifications.

  <!--ML EXAMPLE-->
  <div class="section">
    <h4>Supervised Learning</h4>
    <p>
      Imagine you have collected 50 measurements for height and weight. You want
      to build a machine learning model to predict a subject's weight given
      their height. This is a classic example of a supervised learning problem.
