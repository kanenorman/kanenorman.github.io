    <h4>What is Machine Learning? ðŸ¤”</h4>
    <p>
      Truthfully, it depends on who you ask. For many, machine learning is
      perceived as a mystical black box that provides answers, while others view
      it as sophisticated mathematics capable of predicting the future. Some
      even fear it indicates the end of the world, with Terminator-like robots
      poised to end humanity!
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of ones perspective, at its essence, machine learning revolves
      around creating algorithms that are designed to
      <span class="keyword">identify patterns in data</span> and
      <span class="keyword"
        >make decisions based on the patterns they identify</span
      >. (Not too different from how humans learn, right?)

    <h4>Types of Machine Learning</h4>
    <p>
      Machine learning algorithms can be categorized into different paradigms
      based on how they learn from and process data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="keyword">Supervised Learning:</span> Algorithms are trained
      on labeled data where the desired output is known. For example, in a spam
      email classifier, the algorithm learns from emails labeled as "spam" or
      "not spam" to predict the label of new, unlabeled emails.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="keyword">Unsupervised Learning:</span> Involves algorithms
      learning patterns from data without explicit labels. The goal is to
      explore the structure of the data, such as clustering similar data points
      together or reducing the dimensionality of the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="keyword">Reinforcement Learning:</span> Is about training
      agents to make sequences of decisions by interacting with an environment.
      The agent learns to achieve a certain goal through trial and error,
      receiving feedback in the form of rewards or penalties.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will primarily focus on supervised learning, where the emphasis is on
      training models with labeled data to make accurate predictions or
      classifications.
